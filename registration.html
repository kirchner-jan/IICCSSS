		<h3>Format</h3>
		IICCSSS 2023 will be a 5-day in-person event in <b>T&uuml;bingen, Germany, from September 11 - 15.</b><br>
		There will be talks, interactive workshops, an institute tour and a hackathon.<br>
		We will announce our speakers soon.<br>

                <h3>Fees</h3>
                Other summer schools and conferences take high attendance fees.
                We want to make the event inclusive for everyone and keep the event <b>free of charge</b>.
		However, for your own commitment, you will be asked to pay a <b>deposit of 20€</b>.
		If you attend the summer school, we will reimburse the deposit.<br>
		Of course, you will also be reimbursed, if you cannot make it, just send us an <a href="mailto:info@iiccsss.org">email</a> then.

		<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
		The event is targeted mainly for Bachelor and Master students in Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Linguistics and related fields.
		Also PhDs and Postdocs are of course very welcome.<br>
                However, due to limited room capacity,
                we have to limit the number of participants to a maximum of 75 people,
                assigned by a first-come-first-served policy.<br>
                <!--
                <p style="font-weight:bold;color:red">
                    EDIT: Please note that all of these in-person places are taken already.
                    However, you can still pick the option in the form and we will set you on a waiting list.
                    We will notify you when places get free.
                </p>
                -->

		<h3>Travelling grants</h3>
		To promote attendance of students outside of Germany, you can apply for travelling grants.<br>
		You will have to prove that you travel from abroad and you should ideally sign up for active participation (see Participant contributions).<br>
		For more information, please write us an <a href="mailto:info@iiccsss.org">email</a>.<br>

                <h3>Accommodation in Tübingen</h3>
                We have reserved 36 beds in Tübingen’s <a href="https://www.jugendherberge.de/en/youth-hostels/tuebingen-113/portrait/">youth hostel</a>
                and we recommend staying there together for a better group experience.
                There are rooms with 2-4 beds and breakfast is included for 37.90€ per night.
                <!-- We also provide a discount on this (more information will follow). -->
                If you want to stay at this place, please indicate so in the registration form -- again, first-come-first-served!
                <!--
                <p style="font-weight:bold;color:red">
                    EDIT: Please note that all of these pre-booked beds are taken already.
                    However, you can still pick the option in the form and we will set you on a waiting list.
                    We will notify you when places get free.
                </p>
                -->
                <!-- We will then let you know by email if we can offer you a place from our 36 reserved ones and send you the payment details. -->
                For people who want to organize their own accommodation, we recommend having a look at <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/accommodation/#c430728">uni accommodations</a>.
                Of course you can also try to book a place at the youth hostel directly (beyond our 36 beds reservation).
                Or you book an AirBnB or Couch-surf or camp ...

                <h3>Participant contributions</h3>
                Of course, the summer school is not only meant for you to listen to our speakers, but also to interact with and learn from your peers!
                A great way to do this, is to present a project you are working on as a <b>blitz talk</b> (~15min).
                It is not necessary to commit to a presentation just yet, but in the registration form we will ask you to indicate how likely you are to present.
                We will then contact you again a little bit closer to the event and ask you to provide more information.


                <h3>And now...</h3>
		Registration will open on June 1st.
